# Artificial-UNO

An UNO-game for AIs

## Setup

`artificial-uno` uses Python 3.10 features, you therefore need to run it with Python 3.10 or greater.

I also recommend setting up a virtual environment for this project (see [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

After setting up your virtual environment with the correct Python version, install the projects dependencies by running

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Test

Try running `python unoenv.py`. It should start a game with one player agent and two random agents.
